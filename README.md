# conway-game-of-life
An implementation of the famous Conway's Game of Life, in C. This project uses SDL to render in the grid, and allow the user to enter the inital state of the automaton. Compile instructions can be found at the top of the file.

### What I Learned from the Project

- **Using SDL**:
  - Set up and initialized SDL for creating windows and rendering graphics.
  - Managed real-time rendering and updating of the grid using SDL functions.
  - Handled user input via keyboard and mouse events to interact with the game.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Implemented controls for starting/pausing the simulation and adjusting the speed.
  - Enabled interactive cell toggling with mouse clicks.

These skills were essential for building an engaging and interactive simulation of Conway's Game of Life.
